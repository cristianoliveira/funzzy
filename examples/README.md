### Examples

Here are several examples of workflows that you can use with Funzzy.

In order to test one of these examples run `fzz -c <example>` from the root of the repository.

Example:
Run `fzz -c examples/simple-case.yml` and then change files in `examples/workdir/` to check the output.

Those examples are all valid and used in [the integration tests](https://github.com/cristianoliveira/funzzy/tree/master/tests).
