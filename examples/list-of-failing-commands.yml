## 
# This example contains failing tasks (code != 0)
#
# Scenarios
#  - When running normally with `fzz` it will execute all tasks
#  and report the failings
#
# NOTE: the `--fail-fast` is only available when installing from source
#  - When running with `fzz --fail-fast` it exits once the first task fails.
# The execution sequence is top to down and left to right
