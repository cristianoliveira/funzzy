## FLAG: `--log-file <file_path>`

**Minimal version**: 1.6.0

## Description

Allows you to specify a filepath where the output of the `fzz` command will be logged. This is particularly useful for keeping a record of command executions, especially when running multiple tasks or when you need to review the output later.
When this flag is used, all standard output and error messages generated by the commands executed by `fzz` will be written to the specified logfile AND echoed on the console.

### Pro Tip ;)

On the age of AI, it's very useful to have a logfile to provide as an external context for AI models, as they sometimes can't run commands directly.

Example prompt:
```
codex "giving the logs .tmp/watcher.log is my current implementation working"

• Explored
  └ Read watcher.log

• I see that although all tests pass, the logs show repeated "waiting_until timed out" messages and errors about missing files, which seem intentional based on test names and behaviors. These timeouts likely reflect watchers expecting events or verifying fallback behavior,
  so the implementation appears to be functioning despite these warnings. I'll highlight these observations and suggest checking if those timeouts are expected or need tuning.

> All of the integration binaries that run the watcher logic finish with ok results in .tmp/watcher.log, so the suite is currently passing end-to-end. The repeated Integration Tests: waiting_until timed out. entries—and the cat: … No such file or directory lines—match
  tests that intentionally exercise timeout handling or missing-file scenarios (for example test_it_timesout_after_x_secs_and_inform and test_it_watches_a_list_of_tasks_and_do_not_panic). Because those tests still report success, the implementation is behaving as they
  expect.

  If those timeouts weren’t intentional, you may want to double-check the watcher trigger conditions; otherwise no extra action is needed.
```

## USAGE

```bash
fzz --log-file <file_path>
```

Or using the shorthand version:
```bash
fzz -l <file_path>
```

### Example without the `--log-file` flag

When you execute `fzz` without using the `--log-file` flag, the output will only be displayed on the console:
```bash
$ fzz
Funzzy: echo 'This task will run'
This task will run

Funzzy: exit 1

Funzzy: echo 'Another task'
Another task
```

No log file will be created in this case.

### Example with the `--log-file` flag

When you execute `fzz` with the `--log-file` flag, the output will be written to the specified logfile as well as displayed on the console:
```bash
$ fzz --log-file output.log
Funzzy: echo 'This task will run'
This task will run

Funzzy: exit 1

Funzzy: echo 'Another task'
Another task
```
A file named `output.log` will be created (or overwritten if it already exists). Inspecting the file shows the captured output:
```bash
$ cat output.log
Funzzy: echo 'This task will run'
This task will run

Funzzy: exit 1

Funzzy: echo 'Another task'
Another task
```

Note that the parent directory for `<file_path>` must already exist; `fzz` will truncate an existing file but will not create missing folders.

### Tests

See `tests/watching_with_log_file.rs` for integration coverage of the `--log-file` flag.
