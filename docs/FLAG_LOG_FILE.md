## FLAG: `--log-file <file_path>`

**Minimal version**: 1.6.0

## Description

Allows you to specify a filepath where the output of the `fzz` command will be logged. This is particularly useful for keeping a record of command executions, especially when running multiple tasks or when you need to review the output later.
When this flag is used, all standard output and error messages generated by the commands executed by `fzz` will be written to the specified logfile AND echoed on the console.

## USAGE

```bash
fzz --log-file <file_path>
```

Or using the shorthand version:
```bash
fzz -l <file_path>
```

### Example without the `--log-file` flag

When you execute `fzz` without using the `--log-file` flag, the output will only be displayed on the console:
```bash
$ fzz
Funzzy: echo 'This task will run'
This task will run

Funzzy: exit 1

Funzzy: echo 'Another task'
Another task
```

No log file will be created in this case.

### Example with the `--log-file` flag

When you execute `fzz` with the `--log-file` flag, the output will be written to the specified logfile as well as displayed on the console:
```bash
$ fzz --log-file output.log
Funzzy: echo 'This task will run'
This task will run

Funzzy: exit 1

Funzzy: echo 'Another task'
Another task
```
A file named `output.log` will be created (or overwritten if it already exists). Inspecting the file shows the captured output:
```bash
$ cat output.log
Funzzy: echo 'This task will run'
This task will run

Funzzy: exit 1

Funzzy: echo 'Another task'
Another task
```

Note that the parent directory for `<file_path>` must already exist; `fzz` will truncate an existing file but will not create missing folders.

### Tests

See `tests/watching_with_log_file.rs` for integration coverage of the `--log-file` flag.
