# funzzy [![CI Checks](https://github.com/cristianoliveira/funzzy/actions/workflows/rust.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/cristianoliveira/funzzy/actions/workflows/rust.yml) [![Crate version](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/funzzy.svg?)](https://crates.io/crates/funzzy)

Yet another fancy watcher. (Inspired by [antr](https://github.com/juanibiapina/antr) / [entr](http://entrproject.org/))

Configure execution of different commands using semantic yaml.

```yaml
# .watch.yaml
# list here all the events and the commands that it should execute
# TIP: include '.watch.yaml' in your .git/info/exclude to ignore it.

- name: run my tests
  run: make test
  change: "tests/**"
  ignore: "tests/integration/**"

- name: fast compile sass
  run: compass compile src/static/some.scss
  change: ["src/static/**", "src/assets/*"]

- name: Starwars
  run: telnet towel.blinkenlights.nl
  change: ".watch.yaml"

- name: say hello
  run: say hello
  change: ".watch.yaml"
  run_on_init: true
```

## Motivation

Create a lightweight watcher to run my tests everytime something in my project change.
So I won't forget to keep my tests passing. Funzzy was made with Rust that is why it consumes almost nothing to run.

## Installing

- OSX:

```bash
brew tap cristianoliveira/tap
brew update
brew install funzzy
```

- Linux:

```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cristianoliveira/funzzy/master/linux-install.sh | sh
```

- With Cargo

```bash
cargo install funzzy
```

\*Make sure you have `$HOME/.cargo/bin` in your PATH
`export $PATH:$HOME/.cargo/bin`

#### From source

Make sure you have installed the follow dependecies:

- Rust

Clone this repo and do:

```bash
make install
```

## Running

Initializing with boilerplate:

```bash
funzzy init
```

Change the yaml as you want. Then run:

```bash
funzzy watch
```

Run with some arbitrary command and stdin

```bash
find . -R '**.rs' | funzzy 'cargo build'
```

Run some arbitrary command in an interval of seconds

```bash
funzzy run 'cargo build' 10
```

## Tests

Running tests:

```bash
cargo test
```

or simple `make tests`

## Code Style

We use [clippy](https://github.com/Manishearth/rust-clippy) for lintting the funzzy's source code. Make sure you had validate it before commit.
